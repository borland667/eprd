.SS OPTIONS
.IP -b
Used to enable barriers.
When barriers are enabled filesystems can signal EPRD to flush and sync all dirty buffers to disk.
.IP -c
When EPRD is used with a regular file and attached for the first time -c will enable eprd_setup to create the file with a size that must be specified with -s
.IP -f datafile
Specify either a blockdevice or a regular file. When regular file is used it must either already exist or -c must be specified with -s
.IP -m
This sets the maximum interval at which ERPD will flush writes to disk in seconds.
When -b is also specified writes may be commited to disk before commit interval expires.
.IP -p
Used to set the amount of kernel RAM that EPRD will use to cache read and write requests.
.IP -s NNN[MG]
Only used when EPRD is backed by a regular file.
You can specify the size in bytes as NNN or the size in megabytes as NNNM as well as the size in gigabytes as NNNG
.IP -z
Specifies the sectorsize. Valid options are 512..4096 bytes.
